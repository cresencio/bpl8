## bpl8
My personal boilerplate and build system, decent HTML5 base with normalize, modernizr and bower and gulp already configured for styles and scripts. I usually use Foundation sass, so I've just imported the grid component initially.

###### Installation
In the unlikely event that you decide you wish to use this as a base for your project, here's a quick run down of what you need to do.

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/trybe/bpl8.git` or whatever
2. In the project directory, run `bower install` and `npm install` to grab dependencies
3. Run `gulp`, the default task will watch and compile.
